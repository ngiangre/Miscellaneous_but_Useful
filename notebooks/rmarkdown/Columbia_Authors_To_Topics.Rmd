# Introduction

##### My goal is to get the most probabilistic author at Columbia given a phrase or topic. I'm going to use both R and python to do this. For the R portion, I'm going to use the package RISMed and draw from [here](http://amunategui.github.io/pubmed-query/). For the python portion I'm going to draw heavily from [here](http://mlbernauer.github.io/R/20160319-naive-bayes-information-retrieval.html).**
